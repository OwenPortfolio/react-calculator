# Owen's Calculator

This is a small portfolio project to create a basic calculator in React. Currently this uses a simple flex grid and CSS formatting to arrange and style, it then uses state to create a string of the inputted numbers and operators. When the equals button is hit, it uses ```eval``` to run through the string and finalise. 

This project is still in progress. 

[The hosted version is available here!](https://owen-calculator.herokuapp.com/)

You can test it yourself by cloning the repo and then running ```npm start``` from the terminal. Requires Node.js 18.0.0 and React 18.2.0
