# Owen's Calculator

This is a small portfolio project to create a basic calculator in React. Currently this uses a simple flex grid and CSS formatting to arrange and style, it then uses state to create a string of the inputted numbers and operators. When the equals button is hit, it uses ```eval``` to run through the string and finalise. 

This project is ongoing. There is currently no hosted version but this can be easily tested by cloning the repo and then running ```npm start``` from the terminal.
